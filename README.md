VPSim SystemC
=============

VPSim includes a large library of component models (CPU ARM, perephirals, buses,..). These components are fully standard-compliant SystemC/TLM 2.0 following the Loosely-Timed paradigm with blocking communication interface, which offers a good trade-off between execution speed and accuracy.
The main supported model provider in VPSim is QEMU.
